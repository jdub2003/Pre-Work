# Prework - Background Color Changer

Submitted by: Jordan DuBose

Background Color Changer is an app that contains various labels that introduce me and includes a button that allows users to change the background color with selected. 

Time spent: 1 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 
## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
    - Bible App: Can complete bible plans with friends on the app. Daily reminders. Can track progress through streaks. Can create app widget for home screen.
    - Photos App: Creates memories grouping pictures together from certain events, people, etc. Can make shared albums. Recognizes people and creates a place for photos of them.
    - Gratitude - Journal Prompts App: Ability to track journaling progress through streaks. Can opt into journaling challenges. Daily reminders. Can create app widget for home screen. 
## App Idea:
    Looking at my three favorite apps I think that I would like to build an app that combines all three of these together into a single holistic self-reflection app. It could intergrate the visual memories in the photo app, gratitude journaling features, and have a spiritual aspect to it. The app could allow people to create personalized collections of bible verses, photos, and journal entries. Users could have the ability to also invite friends along in their personal growth journeys and can keep track of their progress with streaks.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
